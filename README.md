UmbCacheDependencies
====================

.Net Cache Dependency Handlers for content and media etc.

This project provides the ability to expire items within the .Net Cache when a content/media type is changed within umbraco.

THIS IS CURRENT BETA!!!


Currently you can provide cache dependency on a single content item id and a media item id.
Future developments may allow you to tie into a Document type name/Media type name so the cache is expired when any of those document types are edited.
